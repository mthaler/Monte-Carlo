# Monte-Carlo
Monte Carlo Method to estimate the value pi

We can estimate pi by randomly distributing points in a square and checking if a point is inside a circle.

If we run the simulation for n=100000000 we for example obtain the value 3.14151736 for pi, which is pretty close to 3.14159265359, the exact value of pi.
